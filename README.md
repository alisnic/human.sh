human.sh
========

Human.sh is a set of aliases for the shell. The main goal of the project is
simple: to able to talk to our console in English.

At this point, human.sh is distributed as a oh-my-zsh plugin, but we plan to
make the aliases available to clean zsh and to bash as well.

## Available aliases
- search <package | file | port | process>
