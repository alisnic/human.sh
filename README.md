human.sh
========

Human.sh is a set of aliases for the shell. The main goal of the project is
simple: to able to talk to our console in English.

At this point, human.sh is distributed as a oh-my-zsh plugin, but we plan to
make the aliases available to clean zsh and to bash as well.

## Installation
`git clone git@github.com:alisnic/human.sh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/humansh`

And then in your .zshrc add "humansh" to *plugins* list.

## Available aliases
- search (package | file | port | process)

TODO:
- make it work in pure bash
- make it OS independent
